## üéß About The Project

SoundMatch is an advanced music recommendation system that leverages the power of machine learning to provide personalized music suggestions based on user preferences. Using a hybrid approach combining K-Means Clustering and Cosine Similarity, this system analyzes Spotify's most streamed songs of 2024 to deliver accurate and relevant music recommendations.

### üìã Project Overview

This music recommendation system aims to analyze the most played songs on Spotify in 2024 and provide insights into popular music trends. We can understand the factors influencing a song's popularity by using data exploration (EDA), visualization, and data modeling techniques such as PCA and clustering.

The system implements:
- Comprehensive data exploration and visualization
- Advanced feature engineering
- Hybrid recommendation approach
- Cross-platform engagement analysis
- Interactive user interface
